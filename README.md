# Sinusoids-prelab
This experiment demonstrates the characteristics of sinusoidal waves using MATLAB and
Simulink. While doing this demonstration, various MATLAB functions and Simulink blocks
are utilized. A list of these functions, blocks and their descriptions in the context they are used
here are given in Table 1 as a reference. It is suggested that at least the main functions and
blocks are well understood in order to carry out the experiment
